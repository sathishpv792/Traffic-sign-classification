Deep learning CNN-based traffic sign classification using image data.

# 🚦 Traffic Sign Classification and Detection using CNN

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **deep learning-based Traffic Sign Classification system** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
The model is trained to accurately recognize and classify different traffic signs from images, which is a crucial component in **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)** and **autonomous driving**.

The entire workflow — from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation — is implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook** using Python.
